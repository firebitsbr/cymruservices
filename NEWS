## Version 0.2.0

- cymru service instability was causing CRAN daily testing errors so
  examples were wrapped in \dontrun{} even though the socketConnection()
  calls were wrapped in tryCatch blocks.
- added a `timeout` parameter to the `whois`-based services
- calls that used to error out and return `NA` now return `NA`-filled `data.frame`s
